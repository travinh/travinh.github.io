With the CLI project, we could be finished with scrapping or using API, and I chose to use API since I think that is the way to learn more about it. And there were some of the challenges that I had to face. 

I started my project online and everything was good until I tried to set up my local environment. At that time, I could not install it so I made a screen share with one of the help techs, and we both agreed that my computer needs to be upgraded to the new version which is OS Catalina. Unfortunately, after I installed new software, the problem was still there and it took me about half of the day to figure out that I need a different command to install my "homebrew" because of the new version.

The next problem I faced is that my request for "get method" caused an error on the last day before the due day. Then I figured out that the API source only allows me to pull some requests per time frame (and it does not show exact time frame). Therefore, I had to start the project over again with different API source which is football API. With this API, it allowed me to have some of the API only, not all; and I had to have my token with it. 

My project was finished 2 days after the due day because of those problems, but I have learned some new things with this project.
