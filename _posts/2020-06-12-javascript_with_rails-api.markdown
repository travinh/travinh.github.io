I had spent 3 days for my js project and it was fantastic. At the beginning, it was a little confuse since it was a new language to me. I had created all my js and css files in the folder of back-end, and it made me waste a lot of time to firgure out all the problems since I tried to connect front-end and back-end. 

Besides that, the hardest challenge for me was about creating user model with js. Since the information could not pull straight from back end to front end, I had to create some "connected" functions. 

After all, I would like to thanks to my cohort for everything he had helped me in this project.
