With Flatiron cources, we usually use FETCH(a browser in-built web API) for REST APIs, but there always another choices for us, and one of them is AXIOS.

The first different between FETCH API and AXIOS is that AXIOS always return as the JSON type for the response and also for the request.

The second feature that I like AXIOS over FETCH is that AXIOS could set the Response Timeout easily, but not FETCH.

In conclusion, AXIOS and FETCH are just 2 of the ways to make API requestes. They all have their pros and cons, and you have to try to see which one you prefer.
