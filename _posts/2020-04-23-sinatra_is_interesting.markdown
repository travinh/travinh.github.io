In my student life, I had studied so many programming languages, and I thought they would be hard until I finished this project. 

With this project, I had thought that would take me couple days to finish, but I was wrong. Thanks Sinatra and Rails because they give me most of the gems and shortcuts that I need to finish the project. All I had to do was running some command lines, and everything was built; then I just needed to write some simple lines of code to get it done.
