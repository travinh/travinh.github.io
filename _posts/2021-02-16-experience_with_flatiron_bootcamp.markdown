After 5 months with Flatiron Bootcamp, I have had a lot of experiences with Flatiron.

First of all, I have graduated from a University for my bachelor degree in computer science, and I have learned a lot of things from there. The reason why I have chose Flatiron because of this school will help me to find a job after I graduate.

Secondly, university will give knowledge to you widely, and you have to figured out a way to narrow them. And I have thought that Flatiron is the place for it. And it is true.

With Flatiron, I have done many projects and learned a lot of things from them. For example, I have learned how to create a new back-end api for my front end quickly using Ruby on Rails. Another example that is I have deployed my portfolio to heroku app by myself, right before I graduate.

In conclusion, Flatiron is a good school to attend for better job.
