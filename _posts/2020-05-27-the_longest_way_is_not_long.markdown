With Rails project, I started using Devise on Rails to make it fast and convenience. Since it already builded a lot of things for developer, we just need to follow the route and set everything up; but it comes with another problem. The problem is that it is hard to customize the controller and route. I created 3 different projects with Devise for testing and it did not work for all of them. 
Then I tried to start over again from scratch. It means I had to build my own MVC for 3 differents models and make all the relationships and validations for all of them. I thought it would take a lot of time but it is not. It was easy to customize and I could do whatever I want with the controller. 
Now, I know that some way would look longer but it will take less time than another.
